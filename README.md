# Kargo Excellerate CI/CD Assignment

My assignment for this section is to create 2 Github Actions pipelines. Consider the long term maintainability for the pipelines. In this case, some forms of abstraction may be preferred, such as using a Makefile or Composite Actions.

The requirement details for each pipe will be detailed below.

## Before Starting

Before working on this assignment, we suggest fulfilling these pre-requisites to help you on your tasks

- Create a Github account with your @kargo.tech email
  - Add `-kargo` suffix on your Github account username. For example, if your Kargo email is `ahmad@kargo.tech`, then your Github username will be `ahmad-kargo`
- Install `git` to your machine, choose your own OS version ([refer here](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
  - (Optional) if you prefer to use GUIs, see the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
- Create a fork of this repository
- Enable Github Actions feature in your forked repository `https://github.com/<your-username>/excellerate-pipeline/actions`
- Choose 1 language for your assignment (go/python/nodejs), your pipelines should fulfill both requirements for the selected language
- Docker hub account (personal)
- (optional) Work on a unix machine, build environment and examples are made for a unix machine
- (optional) Install docker https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
- (optional) Install related language to try relevant commands locally
  - golang https://go.dev/doc/install
  - python
  - nodejs https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

## Tasks

Your tasks are to create 2 pipelines that fulfill the following requirements. Stubs are provided.

* Build
  * Pipeline should trigger on all pushes to master branch.
  * Build and tag a docker image of the app. Give the docker image a tag corresponding to the git commit hash.
  * Push the image to a repository. Please use a personal docker hub account (public repository) for this step.
* Test
  * Pipeline should trigger on all PR.
  * Run unit test for selected app
    * Golang: go test
    * Python: pytest
    * Nodejs: npm test

**NOTE** to show pr test pipeline is running properly, perform the following

1. Create a new branch i.e. `pr-test`
2. Make any change in the `README.md` file
3. Commit the changes
4. Open a Pull Request from the new branch `pr-test` to `master`

## Verification

You can verify the results of your actions configuration by opening the Github Actions tab
